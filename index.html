        <h2>Facility Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This document refers to an unofficial research wing located beneath
            the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Although declared abandoned after 1991,
            evidence suggests continued activity under a sealed initiative
            known internally as Project ΛX.
        </p>

        <h2>Project ΛX</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of Project ΛX was the creation of adaptive bio-synthetic
            entities capable of surviving radiation levels far beyond human
            tolerance. The experiment focused on restructuring living organisms
            rather than shielding them.

            <p>
                The substance demonstrates fluid cohesion and autonomous
                reconfiguration. Contact with organic tissue does not result in
                necrosis. Instead, the host is gradually overwritten while
                remaining conscious.

        <h2>Containment Failure</h2>
        <p class="warning">
            On day 213, multiple containment breaches were recorded across
            Sublevels C and D.
        </p>

        <p>
            Affected personnel reported a loss of bodily autonomy followed by
            accelerated physiological adaptation. Subjects described the
            sensation as painless, yet psychologically destabilizing.

                “It’s learning from me. I can feel it copying the way I think.
                I don’t know if I’m still the original.”

        <h2>Termination Directive</h2>
        <p>
            All physical records were ordered destroyed, and the facility was
            sealed under concrete and lead. Despite this, residual power usage
            has been detected beneath the exclusion zone.
        </p>

        <h2>Cross-Reference Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            Similar organisms have been reported in later, unrelated facilities:
            fluid-based lifeforms prioritizing adaptation, assimilation, and
            survival at the cost of human identity.
